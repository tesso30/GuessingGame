# Guessing Game App

This is a simple Guessing Game application built with Java Swing. The application generates a random number between 1 and 100 and challenges the user to guess it. The user will be given feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low, and the number of attempts taken will be displayed once the correct number is guessed.

## Features

- Random number generation between 1 and 100.
- User input for guesses.
- Feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
- Display of the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number.
- Simple GUI created using Java Swing.
